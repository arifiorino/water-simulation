# Water
Eulerian water simulation with marker particles.  
Inspired by the Marker-And-Cell method developed by Francis Harlow in 1963.  
Also the advection scheme by Jos Stam in 1999.  
Also the explanations in the Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics book by Robert Bridson.  

Simulation was first written in python with numpy and matplotlib.  
Then translated to more efficient C++ in an Xcode project which uses Metal to render triangles
using the marching tetrahedra algorithm.
